# DeepDock-Cophore-TM: Large-Scale-AI-Driven-Docking-and-Pharmacophore-Screening-TransmembraneSites
This protocol combines deep docking (originally developed by Gentile et al in 2020 with pharmacophore screening to screen for new drug leads from ultra-large chemical spaces. 
The entire workflow includes chemical library processing, docking with autodock, deep docking, pharmacophore filtering, redocking with gnina. 
It also details setup scripts for classical MD and umbrella sampling for membrane partitioning of hits.
